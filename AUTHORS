The ArchiefBeheerComponent was originally developed in the municipality
of Utrecht and called the Record Management App. Later, it was turned into a
Common Ground project backed by several municipalities.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made the components that
much better:

    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Silvia Amabilino <silvia@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The municipality of Utrecht and Delft for their active support in creating
    this application.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
