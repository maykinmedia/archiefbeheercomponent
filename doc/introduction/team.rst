Who's behind the ArchiefBeheerComponent?
========================================

Initially, the ArchiefBeheerComponent was called the Archiefvernietigingscomponent (and before that Record Management
App) and was created by the municipality of Utrecht. Later, it was picked up
by several municipalities to iterate on the work to create a re-usable
application. In alphabetical order, they are:

* Delft
* Haarlem
* Rotterdam
* Tilburg
* Utrecht

The municipality of Utrecht and Delft take the lead in this project and the
application is developed by `Maykin Media`_ under the
`Open Gemeente Initiatief`_.
