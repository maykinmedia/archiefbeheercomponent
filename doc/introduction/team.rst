Who's behind the Archiefvernietigingscomponent?
===============================================

Initially, the Archiefvernietigingscomponent was called the Record Management 
App and was created by the municipality of Utrecht. Later, it was picked up
by several municipalities to iterate on the work to create a re-usable 
application. In alphabetical order, they are:

* Delft 
* Haarlem
* Rotterdam 
* Tilburg
* Utrecht

The municipality of Utrecht and Delft take the lead in this project and the
application is developed by `Maykin Media`_ under the 
`Open Gemeente Initiatief`_.
